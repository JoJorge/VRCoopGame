This script was developed by Jupp Otto. It's free to use and there are no restrictions in modification.
If there are any questions you can send me an Email: juppotto3@gmail.com
This script moves your player automatically in the direction he is looking at. You can 
activate the autowalk function by pull the cardboard trigger, by define a threshold angle 
or combine both by selecting both of these options.
The threshold is an value in degree between 0° and 90°. So for example the threshold is 
30°, the player will move when he is looking 31° down to the bottom and he will not move 
when the player is looking 29° down to the bottom. This script can easally be configured
in the Unity Inspector. 
How to get started with this script?: 
0. haven't the Google VR SDK yet, follow this guide https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started
1. Import the exampple package downloaded in step 0 (GoogleVRForUnity.unitypackage).
2. Load the GVRDemo scene.
3. Attach a Rigidbody to the "Player" GameObject.
4. Freeze X, Y and Z Rotation of the Rgidbody in the inspector. 
5. Attach a Capsule Collider to the "Player" GameObject.
6. Attach the Autowalk script to the "Player" GameObject.
7. Configure the Script in the insector for example: 
      - walk when triggered   = true 
      - speed                 = 3  
8. Make sure your ground have a collider on it. (Otherwise you will fall through it)
9. Start the scene and have fun!
